# Live Chat Software

## Objective 
The objective for this program is to create a simple group chat application using the Node.js stack. 
HTML and Bootstrap is used to implement a tabbed login and register interface. 
A logged in user types a message in chat and, on send, this message is recorded in a message collection within the database with keys for the document schema.
When user accesses the chat page, all of the messages are read from the database and passed to EJS for rendering. The chat content is dynamic.


## Equipment 
Computer running Windows, MacOS or Linux, with an Intel or AMD based processor (x86 or x86-64). VS Code, and a browser such as FireFox or Chrome, is recommended.
